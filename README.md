In week 3, I was able to work on different functions and formulars. 
I was able to use the Sum, average, median, mode functions. 
I also used the concantenate function to join different text. 
I also used the Vlook up function to ease accessing related information on different rows and column.
I also used the trim functions, proper case etc to easily arranged texts.
